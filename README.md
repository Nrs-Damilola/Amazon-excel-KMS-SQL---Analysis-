MY PROJECT

Amazon-excel/KMS-SQL---Analysis-

This project showcases the practical data analysis skills I acquired from the DSA Incubator Hub, focusing on real-world business data using Microsoft Excel and SQL.

Using an Amazon product dataset, I performed detailed analysis with Excel features such as Pivot Tables, formulas, and dashboards. I also worked with SQL to clean, transform, and query structured datasets for valuable insights.
